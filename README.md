## Contributing

DevNQ welcomes contributions to our governance documentation. Users are free
to submit amendments, changes and fixes to all of our governance
documentation.

DevNQ will endeavour to assess, approve and ratify any amendments to these
documents in a timely manner.

### How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull
requests to see whether someone else has already made contributions to these
areas. You may be able to assist by reviewing their work, or addressing their
issue.

If there isn't an existing issue or pull request on your specific area of
concern or interest consider the scale and impact of your contribution before
proceeding:

* If your contribution is minor, such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* If your contribution is major, such as a new clause, or paragraph,
  or a document restructure, start by opening an issue and collecting feedback
  and approval first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion
  before you do any work.

Remember that some documentation in this repository is restricted in how it
can legally be modified. Other documentation may require specific wording or
clauses to meet DevNQ's legal obligations. This may mean we cannot accept your
changes, or maintainers must gain additional approval before merging.

To make a contribution to this repository we recommend using the standard
[Fork and Pull Request
Workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) to submit a
pull request which can be reviewed by our maintainers.

### Expectations

* Contributors to all DevNQ projects are expected to conform to the
  [DevNQ Code of
  Conduct](https://github.com/devnq/governance/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
  All contributors should read and understand these rules before making any
  commits, issues, comments, or pull requests.
* Changes to documents in this repository may require approval, votes,
  or a legal process to be undertaken in order to ratify modifications.  This
  may delay the acceptance of some changes, and also result in the rejection
  of other changes. Contributors should expect a high level of rigour and
  review be undertaken for any amendments to this documentation.
* Copyrighted content should only be included in DevNQ documentation
  with the copyright holder's permission. Contributions containing copyrighted
  content should be accompanied with evidence of the copyright holder issuing
  DevNQ unlimited and perpetual rights to utilise their content in our
  governance documentation.
