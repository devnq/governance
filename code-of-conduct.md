DevNQ is committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment, making
participation in our community, events and projects fun and harassment-free.
As a diverse community, it is important that DevNQ sets standard for
acceptable behaviour for all of our community members and representatives.

## Scope

The Code of Conduct applies to all individuals attending or engaging with
DevNQ events, social media pages, digital communities or any individuals
representing DevNQ in any form.

## Be Inclusive and Respectful

It is the responsibility of all DevNQ members and representatives to respect
and include everybody in our community.

When engaging with the DevNQ community:

* Use welcoming language and inclusive terms
* Respect the rights of others to express their viewpoints, opinions
  and ideals
* Be empathetic and understanding of the experiences of others
* Ensure criticism is constructive and relevant
* Ensure all content and physically- or digitally-shared material is
  suitable for people aged 12 and above
* Members should use language which is appropriate for an all-ages
  audience as far as possible

## Unacceptable Behaviour

The following actions are considered unacceptable in the DevNQ community and
may result in disciplinary actions:

* sexualised language or imagery
* unwelcome sexual attention
* derogatory comments
* personal or political attacks
* exclusionary jokes and comments
* deliberate intimidation
* harassment (whether in person, or digital)
* publication of private or personal information (including email
  address) without permission
* offensive remarks related to (whether spoken, or digitally shared),
  or discrimination and/or exclusion based on age, body size, disability,
  ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of
  experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
  appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation
* conduct which is considered unethical or inappropriate by the DevNQ
  organisers committee
* conduct which is considered illegal under the laws of the State of
  Queensland or the Commonwealth of Australia

## Incident Reporting & Enforcement

Instances of any unacceptable behaviour may be reported to DevNQ
representatives at events or by contacting the DevNQ organisers committee at
<info@devnq.org>.

All reports are taken seriously and will be reviewed and investigated,
resulting in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances.  DevNQ is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to
the reporter of an incident.

Representatives of DevNQ, acting in good faith, may take immediate action to
enforce this Code of Conduct, such as:

* asking individuals to modify or cease their behaviour
* advising individuals that further enforcement action may be taken
  if the behaviour continues
* temporarily removing individuals from a venue
* restricting the access of individuals to DevNQ digital communities
  (ie. Slack, GitHub, etc.)
* reporting the incident to police or other authorities

Following review and investigation of an incident, the organisers committee of
DevNQ may take further action to enforce this Code of Conduct such as:

* permanently banning individuals from attending DevNQ events
* permanently banning individuals from accessing DevNQ digital communities
* reporting the incident to police or other authorities
